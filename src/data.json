      "Thanks to Emilie's keen observation and experience babysitting, she felt that Milo was ready to attempt visits to the potty. From Emilie's reading, some countries in Europe seldom see kids in diapers beyond the age of 2. After about a week sans pants, and only a few accidents, Milo was able to signal and communicate that he had to go.  Night time training is a different story as he still wears a diaper for bed and naptimes.",

A handful of Milo's friends and parents attended. As usual, mom's chocolate birthday cake with buttercream icing was a hit! After he blew out the candle, he literally dove face first into the cake!",
